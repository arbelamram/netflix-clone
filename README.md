## Project Description
This project is a simple clone of Netflix, focusing on the front-end aspect of the application. It showcases the use of ReactJS hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`), Axios for API requests, and integrates YouTube trailers using `react-youtube` and `movie-trailer` libraries. The application allows users to browse through different categories of movies, view details, and watch trailers.</br>
